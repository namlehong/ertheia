My master is the ruler of Aden Castle, renowned throughout the world for his wisdom and strength. To you who have gained possession of this fortress, he sends these words: "Prove your loyalty with this contract!"<br>
Unless you do so, my lord will know that your loyalty is suspect. Make your decision!<br>
