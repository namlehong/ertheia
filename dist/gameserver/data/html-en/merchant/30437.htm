I am trader Rolento of the Silver Scales Guild! I have been dispatched by my guild to open a shop here. As the link between Giran and Gludin, this location is perfect for commerce. Of course, there was fierce competition in the guild over who should be sent here, but I'm the one who finally got this plum assignment! So...how can I help you?<br>
