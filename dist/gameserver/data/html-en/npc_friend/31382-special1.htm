Your reputation as a valiant warrior grows everyday, along with the joy in my heart!  I now hope that before long, we'll be able to settle in the promised land!<br>
I've been ordered to supply a higher-level pouch to you, but unfortunately, I can't give you the strongest armor yet!  Come back when you've had more experience, and are qualified to open the box.<br>
Bring me a <font color="LEVEL">Nepenthes Seed</font> and I'll give you whatever you want! Care to take a look?<br>
