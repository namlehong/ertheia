He has his loyal subordinates, their group is called <font color="LEVEL">Wings of Sand</font>.<br>
They are preparing the attack simultaneously so it'll be hard to defeat them.<br>
But there's a way. Use Dragon Vortex to summon any of the seben of them: <font color="LEVEL">Emerald Horn, Dust Rider, Bleeding Fly, Black Dagger Wing, Shadow Summoner, Spike Slasher, Muscle Bomber</font>.<br>
