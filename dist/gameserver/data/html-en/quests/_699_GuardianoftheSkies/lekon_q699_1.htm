I'm searching for an adventurer who can defeat the Master Rider which wanders around the area and pirating, attacks soldiers who are coming back from the mission. <br>
Kill Master Rider in order to completely eliminate the problem instead of catching his subordinate, Vulture Riders...<br>
I will reward you for every killed monster.<br>
