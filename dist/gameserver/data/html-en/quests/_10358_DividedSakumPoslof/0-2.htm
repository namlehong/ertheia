I understand that <font color="LEVEL"> Poslov </font> is <font color="LEVEL"> someone </font> 
<font color="LEVEL"> Like </font> double Sakuma
<br>
According to the other guards, he is not the only one. 
It makes me sad ...
<br>
As is the fact that the location of Poslov is still not 
established. Detect it hinder us 
the local monsters. Could you do with them 
deal?
