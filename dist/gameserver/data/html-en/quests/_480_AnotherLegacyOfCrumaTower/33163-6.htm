<font color="LEVEL"> Martes </ font> - a monster of a tower with relics
which must find our Krasis. We have already destroyed many of the inhabitants of the towers,
but found nothing of any value. We've been desperate to ...
but then found out about the existence of Martesa. It seems that it is more important figure,
than just a guard tower Cruma. That's why he keeps a particularly valuable relics and
so protected. Among other things, it must have incredible power.<br>
You should act consistently and quickly to destroy the monster and bring
I <font color="LEVEL"> core Martesa </ font>. I think to remove it is not difficult.
When you get the kernel, then use it to be able to come back.
In the end, for you will be a part of the body Martesa and you will have the ability to
manage the space, like himself. I think because of that his gift
Martes could hide from us in the Tower of Cruma. Do not worry, it will not affect
on your health. At least I hope so ... Is this: how will extract core,
wear it here with all haste.<br>
