Hm… now that I think about it, might I tempt you with a mission from Dominic? It is not that I am incapable of doing it, but my face is too well known. Not like yours, at least not around here.<br>
Besides, you're already here, and if Dominic saw fit to trust you with this parcel, I see no reason not to trust you myself.<br>
