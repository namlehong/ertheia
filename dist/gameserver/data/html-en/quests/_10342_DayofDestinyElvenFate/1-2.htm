So many monsters have managed to break 
through already, and Captain Adolph took his 
finest soldiers to engage them. Any operations like 
this will have casualties, but it`s been bad this 
time... bad, indeed.
<br>
I want to collect the dog tags of the dead to give 
to their families. It`s realy the least we can do. 
The only problem is, we know that they died 
generally in the Cemetary area, but we haven`t 
managed to recover any of the bodies. The 
fighting was most intense around the center 
fountain, angel statue, and stone tower, so we 
should look there first. I have several people on 
this, so please just bring me 4 dog tags from the 
fallen.
