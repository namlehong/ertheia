<br>
Calling all adventurers! Dolphren is lookinf for 
brave warriors to help collect research materials! 
Listen in for details.
<br>
Research on the Giant relics is progressing at a 
somewhat slower pace than expected, as our 
efforts have been increasingly hampered by the 
emerging monster threats and ongoing wars. To 
help, Dolphren has suggested concentrating on 
the <font color="LEVEL">Silent Valley</font> and has offered significant 
compensation for all those who agree to help!
