Once you receive your invitation, hurry to the Ceremony of Chaos and display your abilities.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">If you participate twice and bring back 2 Remnants of Competition</font>, I'll give you a small gift.<br>
These gifts can only be received twice a day, and <font color="LEVEL">you must remain in the arena until the match ends in order to receive the Remnant!</font><br>
Good luck!<br>
