We think they were looking for anything 
related to the Giants, and tried to steal 
<font color="LEVEL">The War of Gods and Giants</font>, an ancient 
book that was discovered in Ye Sagira.
<br>
It has many stories about the powers of the 
Giants, how that power can be learned, and 
about others species from their time. Now 
that the island has crashed, perhaps we 
should think about safeguarding the book...
