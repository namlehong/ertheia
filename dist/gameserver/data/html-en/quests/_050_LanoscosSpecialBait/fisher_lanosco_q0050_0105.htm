Thanks for your help. I can't get around to get the materials I need like I used to... 
Now I'll make the <font color="LEVEL">bait of wind</font> for you. I use the repulsive power between the elements of water and wind. 
Just as water and air don't mix, things that are underwater begin to float.<br>
Now, give me the <font color="LEVEL">100 essences of wind</font>!<br>
