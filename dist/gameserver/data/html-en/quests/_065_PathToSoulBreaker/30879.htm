Why did you come to me? The cargo has been
delayed by a storm. If that's what you're here
for, you'll have to wait a little longer. We're not
delaying things on purpose, I promise you.<br>
You're looking for someone? There are many
people moving about this wharf... i'am afreid you'll
have to be a little specific...<br>
