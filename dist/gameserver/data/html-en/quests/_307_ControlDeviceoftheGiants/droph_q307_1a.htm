There is a Raid Monster named <font color="LEVEL">Hekaton Prime</font> in the deep substratum of this Giants' Cave. In fact, it is the central core that controls this area!<br>
If we can expel it, our exploration will be much easier. Doing so is beyond my power, though.<br>
Perhaps you have some equally powerful friends who would be willing to help you do it? I'll happily pay you for your work!<br>
