I need your help to find out the secret Gardeners Management animals.
Recently, I saw something. If there are uncontrollable animals, one of the gardeners takes them into
Cave of Roses. As soon as they inhale the scent of roses, immediately become calm and fall asleep.
I am sure that they are affected by the smell. To conduct research necessary to obtain blood samples from the animals asleep,
visit this cave. I would like to have extracted samples from you.<br>
