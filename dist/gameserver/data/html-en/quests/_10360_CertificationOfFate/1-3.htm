<br>
Phew ... I understand what you want. But for now
the problem is not only Sakuma. This has created a monster
Kanilova with Poslovom that would eat with them
using the energy of living things.
<br>
Now the soldiers on the Heath are trying their
stop ... But they are few, and they seem to be lacking
abilities. Find <font color="LEVEL"> Guardian </font> Joel on
Heathland and destroy <font color="LEVEL"> together </font> Kanilova. When
get a handle on this monster, Joel will show the way to
Sakuma. I really hope for you.
