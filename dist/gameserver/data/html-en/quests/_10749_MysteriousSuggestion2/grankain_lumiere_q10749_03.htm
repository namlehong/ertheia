I want you to participate in the Mysterious Mansion's <font color="LEVEL">Ceremony of Chaos until you have 5 Remnants of Competition</font>. Do it, and you will receive a small gift from me, one that can only be received once a day.<br>
Remember, <font color="LEVEL">you must remain inside until the end of the match to receive the remnant.</font><br>
And one last thing: every day from 5:00PM to 12:00PM, on every hour, and half past every hour, you will receive an invitation to the Ceremony of Chaos.<br>
Good luck!<br>
