Greetings. I am Blane, Guard of Giran Castle Town. Our village has loads of items that you cannot buy in other places. If you're lucky, you'll find a valuable item. I once went to buy something, but my meager wages weren't quite enough to pay for it. It was some kind of luxury shop or something... If you have the chance, check it out, they have some great things.<br>
