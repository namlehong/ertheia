Oh! Nice to meet you, adventurer. What brings you here to the town of Oren? This town is surrounded by many dangerous areas, which place would you like to know about? The Sea of Spores is located to the northwest, the Ivory Tower to the north, the Tower of Oren to the northeast, and <font color="LEVEL">Enchanted Valley</font> to the east.<br>
There are other places, besides the ones I've mentioned, that are dangerous too; if you want to know more, ask other guards. I know a little about the <font color="LEVEL">Enchanted Valley...</font> Are you interested?<br>
