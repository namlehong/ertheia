<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Radic:<br>
Hello, adventurer. Welcome to the Ivory Tower! I recommend that you deposit your items here and have a look around. You are in the 1st basement, where you will find various guilds for wizards and magi. This place is literally a village built for wizards by wizards. <br>
During the reign of the Elmoreden Empire, the Tower's influence rivaled even that of the emperor...<br>
