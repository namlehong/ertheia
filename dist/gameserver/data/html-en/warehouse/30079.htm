<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Barder:<br>
Um... You want to send a package? All these visitors have made our little village a virtual beehive of activity, so we're a little rushed here. You know, before I was a warehouse keeper here, I was an adventurer like you. But after a life of travel, I finally realized that greed serves no purpose... Surprised to hear a Dwarf say that? Well, well.<br>
Now then, who is going to receive this package? I'll need a name in order to find out where he lives, right?<br>
