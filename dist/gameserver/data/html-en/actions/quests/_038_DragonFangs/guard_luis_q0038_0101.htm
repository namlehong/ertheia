I`ve been looking for someone like you.<br>
I trast you've seen the havoc wrought throughout Gludio Territory. It was enough to have Ol Mahum Stragglers and Turek Orcs bthering us. Now the Lizardmenfrom the south!<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">highway of the southern shoreline</font> that leads to Giran has seen frequent  attacs by <font color="LEVEL">Langk Lizardmen</font>. People are scared. Even the temple priests traveling to Gludin were attacked!  We Gludio guards traveling to Gludin were attacked! We Gludio guards
are already stretched thin.<br>
Will you help us?  <br>
