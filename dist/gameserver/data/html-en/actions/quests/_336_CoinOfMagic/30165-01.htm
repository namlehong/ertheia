Isn't the power of magic great? It turned this item into such a beautiful object. Although I'm just a simple trader, I can't help but bow my head to such a masterpiece...<br>
By the way what would you like to trade for it? All I have are these coins... and, if you would like to trade with me, you will need <font color="LEVEL">Gold Drake, Gold Knight, Silver Golem, Blood Drevanuls, Blood Werewolf and Silver Fairies</font>. Take a look at my items and make a choice.<br>
