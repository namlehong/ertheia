<html><body><font color="FFFFFF">Detention Camp Warden:</font><br>
Thank you for volunteering to help!<br>
The dungeon monster camp in this fortress was only recently discovered.<br>
Apparently, some long-dead emperor created this place years and years ago in order to breed the monsters for the sake of magical experimentation.<br>
Another rumor says that this place was used as a prison for criminals and evil creatures.<br>
Whatever the real reason for its existence, the entrance had been hidden for a very long time.<br>
Since you've volunteered your services, your task will be to eliminate <font color="LEVEL">Brand the Exile, Commander Koenig and Gerg the Hunter</font>, creatures that are members of the last of <font color="LEVEL">three small groups</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">fortress dungeon</font> and obtain the <font color="LEVEL">sign of the camp prisoner's leader</font>.<br>
