O Shilen!<br>
Let this broken sentinel return to its master's side!<br>
Travel to a place where the thick trees lean against a cliff and hold their hands together.<br>
To a place where the Elrokian warriors of old cast off their worn bodies and left on the journey from which no man returns.<br>
Were it within my power, I would already be with them!<br>
Oh, my silver-armored master...<br>
