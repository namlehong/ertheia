Thank you!<br>
Listen closely as I tell you what you need to do. <font color="LEVEL">Lilith</font> has blocked access to the Seal by <font color="LEVEL">summoning a fire wall</font>, but the fires can be extinguished by this <font color="LEVEL">holy water</font>.<br>
Once that has been done, there's a <font color="LEVEL">red door</font> that you'll need to go through.<br>
