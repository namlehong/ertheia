Yes, magically transformed. You'll be visually indistinguishable from the priests. But as any spy worth his salt knows, there's more to a disguise than getting dressed into fancy rags. Gotta play the part too, move like them, talk like them, think like them.<br>
Right, enough chat. Your first task will be to see the <font color="LEVEL">Frog King</font> at the nearby <font color="LEVEL">lake</font> and swindle him out of somethin' precious.<br>
Think on your feet, act fast, and get out of there before they have your legs for lunch. Remember what I told you and keep your wits about you!<br>

(The transformation will cancel all movement and speed related buffs.)
