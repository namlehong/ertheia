Head Blacksmith Ferris:<br>
Preparations for the construction of the ring complete. It remains to wait until the ring is ready. I do not know whether you told coach, but this subject will help you reach enlightenment. <br>
Now go to the <font color="LEVEL">Glowing Swamp</font>, <font color="LEVEL"> marines kill Orc Footman, snipers Orc Footman, Shaman Orc Footman, Bishop Orc Footman </ font> and collect the <font color="LEVEL">12 Crystal Experience</font>. <font color="LEVEL">Let the coach sends you. Otherwise, you will not get the Crystal Experience.</font> If the mentor will be there, he will see how much you have progressed in training, and help when needed. His presence is important to you both. Good luck!<br>
