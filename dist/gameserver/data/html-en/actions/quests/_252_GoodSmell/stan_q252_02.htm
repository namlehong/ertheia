What? Oh, sorry. It's just... Someone cooked something and it smells REALLY good. But yes, we called it Skyshadow Meadow until the Sel Mahums started using it for battle training. Gave it some goofy name… Sel Mahum Training Grounds I think. Should have named it 'What the hell is that delicious smell??'.<br>
Hey, good buddy of mine, how about a little adventure? Find what is making that yummy smell and bring it to me? PLEASE?<br>
