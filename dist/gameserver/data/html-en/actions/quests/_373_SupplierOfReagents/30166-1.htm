I used to supply potions for research to the Sorcerers of the Ivory Tower. However, recently i went too busy with another duties and the supply of potions was interrupted. I am looking for somebody else to gather the needed reagents on my behalf or even further, one skilled enough to mix the reagents and bring me potions ready for delivery.
Of course, i know better than anybody else this is a time consuming risky task so the one that becomes my partner in the business will have for sure access to interesting bargains. What you say, will you help me?<br>
