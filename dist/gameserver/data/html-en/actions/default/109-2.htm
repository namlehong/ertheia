The Memories of a Newbie for summons provides the "Newbie Support buffs", which can be received up to level 75, to the veteran adventurer's summons of level 76 or more.<br>
This is an additional gift given by the Temple, so that all of you can focus on training. This is a small reward to all the great adventurers who fought on the front lines when our world was in danger. Please note that it will only be available <font color="LEVEL">during the time I'm dispatched</font>.<br>
Your summon will receive the following buffs (these buffs do not apply to pets):<br>
Wind Walk, Shield, Magic Barrier, Bless the Body, Bless the Soul, Vampiric Rage, Acumen, Regeneration, Concentration, Haste, and Empower.<br>
