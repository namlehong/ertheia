Welcome to! My name is Orahochin, I am the proud warrior tribe Elroki! My mission is to protect this
place. Actually, I hope I keep and the very future of the tribe. Do you understand? Oh, my young friend, I hope your
boots faster than your brain! Ha ha!<br>Vidis island over there? There you will find the village of innocent and peaceful Elroki. I can assure you that they are very
different from degraded Elrokhians.<br>I post on the island, only those who cause them harm. Ah ... Did you not look even dangerous. If you want, I'll post you
to the island.<br><br>
