Welcome! I can see you are new here! I represent the Bronze Key Guild, Our guild collects items, and we instruct young adventurers who wish to someday go on great journeys like the heroes of the ancient sagas.<br>
As you gain experience, I'll have new teaching for you. So if you wish your name to be as a hero here in the Spine Mines, come back to me when you reach Levels 6,11 and 16!<br>
