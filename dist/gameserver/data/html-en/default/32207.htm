<html><head>Master Orkurus:<br>
I am Orkurus, a Master of the Kamael Guild here. Is this your first visit to Oren Castle Town? Unique, is it not? Some say the atmosphere here is dreary and dark, but I do not think so.<br>
In fact, it feels very much like home to me — no unnecessary ornamentation or frivolity. What do you think?<br>
