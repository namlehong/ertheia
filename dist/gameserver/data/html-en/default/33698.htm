Pick your feet up and keep your nose clean. And don't slouch.<br>
A note on our system here in <font color="LEVEL">Guillotine Fortress</font>: I administrate some of the assignments Roderik or Endrigo give, but you'll be responsible for reporting others. We're sticklers for organization here, so don't let things pile up.<br>
