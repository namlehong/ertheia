The blood of the creatures that have been under the control of the Black Ice Crystal for a long time gradually changes to silver. The Ice Queen's pets are enticed by this blood, and we must have it for our plan as well. Please collect the Silver Hemocytes for us. The monsters in the Frozen Labyrinth that have Silver Hemocytes are the Massive Maze Bandersnatch, Panthera, Pronghorn, Ice Tarantula, Frost Tarantula, Frost Buffalo, Lost Buffalo, Ursus, Lost Yeti and Frost Yeti.<br>
