I operate this grocery store and my hobby has reached this point... Wait here a moment...<br>
Ah, right. Here it is.<br>
OK, and here are the coins that I have... I am collecting <font color="LEVEL">blood succubus, blood basilisk, silver dryad, silver undine, gold giant and gold wyrms</font>. Would you like to choose from things that I have?<br>
