Yes, Antharas can never really be killed… not yet anyway. You may have heard stories from other adventurers how they have killed him again and again. Each time he is killed, he resurrects even more powerful. I fear that the greed of adventurers has caused Antharas to become overwhelmingly powerful.<br>
You will need an army to follow you if you have any hope of defeating Antharas now.<br>
