Excellent! You came back! Was it difficult to collect ancient pieces?<br>
Hum... what is it? You have some ancient scrolls here, but those are of no use to me until you translate its contents,
 i have no time to do it on my own and that's why i gave you the dictionary.
 Anyway i can check any other ancient item you may have...<br>
