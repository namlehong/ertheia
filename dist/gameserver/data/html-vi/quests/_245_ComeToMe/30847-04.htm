Head Blacksmith Ferris:<br>
I'm going to make a decent ring. But first it is necessary to obtain the basic materials. I did not do it out of nothing. <br>
It's very simple. Bring me out of <font color="LEVEL">Blasing Swamp</font> <font color="LEVEL">15 Bonfire ash</font>, killing <font color="LEVEL">Lava Wyrm and Marsh Predator</font>. Other materials I receive from your tutors.<br>
