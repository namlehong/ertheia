Excellent! You came back! Was it difficult to collect ancient books?<br>
Hum... what is it? You have some untranslated book fragments here, but those are of no use to me until you translate its contents, i have no time to do it on my own and that's why i gave you the dictionary Cliff sent to me.
 Anyway i can check any other translated fragments you may have...<br>
