After seeing the the coffin you have noticed the inscription:<br>
Here lies the Holy Sopina who devoted his life to the kingdom Elmoreden, and death - Einhasad. Yes, she will sing a song of praise recovered by it. Yes die in the throes of death, turned away from the holy doctrine, or trying to get her strength.<br>
This is not a real grave of Solina.
