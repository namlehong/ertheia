<br>
Ancient monster Sakuma, ruining the Wasteland
near the Hill windmills,
now directed towards Dion Castle. I
just sent soldiers there and deliver the news.
<br>
But we can not relax, because I do not
know when Sakuma dostigent Giran. at this
moment, all powerful warriors along with the ruler
away from the city. Hmm ... Even if they are
received the order to return, will not go
less than a week.
<br>
This is very dangerous, but I believe that you can easily
manage. Therefore, the task to destroy Sakuma
will be given to you as a test to <font color="LEVEL"> get </font>
* occupation *. I understand that this is a difficult task ...
So, what do you think? Manage?
