<html><body>Grand Master Elina:
<br>
I've heard a lot about you from the Guardians wasteland. You
quickly destroyed Sakuma ... To be honest, I
amazed. I want to thank you on behalf of all
local residents. He was awakened by Sakuma Embryo
have not found, but I do not think you need much
worry about it.
<br>
Now I'll change your profession, as promised.
<br>
Tell me what profession you want to select.
