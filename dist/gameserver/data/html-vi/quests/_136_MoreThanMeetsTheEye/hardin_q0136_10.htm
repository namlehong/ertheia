Ah, I see that you have brought me the Stabilized Ectoplasm. Excellent!<br>
I see you are bursting with questions; let me satisfy at least a portion of your curiosity.<br>
Through research and experiment, I have arrived at certain conclusions.<br>
The energy that makes up the soul is like the water in a water balloon. Depending on the shape of the balloon, it can be shaped into different forms, but once the shape within the water balloon is fixed, it cannot endure anoter change it form.<br>
Another example: melted plaster can be fashioned into ant shape, but once it hardens it must be broken in order to change it's form.<br>
The souls of gods are eternal and immortal, and therefore free from bodily constraints. As a result, the gods can come and go as they please, appearing in different forms at their whim.<br>
This is why transformation magic was originally the province of the gods alone.<br>
