Ivory Tower Wizard Belkadhi:<br>
In the past, the Ivory Tower dispatched many female wizards here. I think that many people here failed to take them seriously, and... well, let's just say that relationship degenerated. Some of the ancient ruins were destroyed in the ensuing battles, and now only male wizards are allowed to be sent here.<br>
I can tell you, things are unstable here right now. If you want to proceed, you'd be well advised to make your preparations first.<br>
