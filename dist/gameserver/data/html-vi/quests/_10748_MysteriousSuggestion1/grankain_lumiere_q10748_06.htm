Still here, eh? You still don't have the Remnants of Competition, so let me tell you again. Every day from 5:00PM to 12:00PM, on every hour, and half past every hour, you will receive an invitation to the Ceremony of Chaos. Go to wherever the invitation draws you, and if you show your abilities, you will receive a great power. If you participate twice and bring back 2 Remnants of Competition, I'll give you a small gift.<br>
These gifts can only be received twice a day, and you must remain in the arena until the match ends in order to receive the Remnant!<br>
