You're back! I've been waiting for you! We must hurry!<br>
Word has come from the guards that Langk lizardmen are attacking travelers again! They must be dealt with immediately! Please give me Magister Rohmer's reply!<br>
Just as I thought! We can do this, we just need to gather the ingredients we need to nullify their sorcery. We'll have this problem resolved soon! Will you help me finish the job?<br>
