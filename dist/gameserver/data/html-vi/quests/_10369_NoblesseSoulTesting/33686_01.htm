You probably know that Shilen has been resurrected, but did you also know that Shilen was the Goddess of Water before she became a fallen goddess? When she became the Goddess of Destruction, the power of water came to me.<br>
However, since her resurrection, the waters have been getting increasingly contaminated due to the influence of her power.<br>
I should purify this contamination as the current Goddes of Water. However, I cannor reach to all the tained locations, and need your help.<br>
Can you help me?<br>
