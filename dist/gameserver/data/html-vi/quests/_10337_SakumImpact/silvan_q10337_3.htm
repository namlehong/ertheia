Here Stay here for three days. After that you just 
do not want to do anything. You do not care 
will have to take the job, so 
stop grumbling and get busy.

I think you should catch <font color="LEVEL"> 15 </font> sceleton warriors, and 
and <font color="LEVEL"> 20 Devils of Ruins and Bat </font> 25. It was then that 
you are sure to find what you were looking for, is not it?
