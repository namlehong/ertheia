<html><body>Guillotine Fortress Watchman Roderik:<br>
The reason the dead souls were reborn in such a vile form is due to the waste that's been dumped here. The traces of the catastrophe seem to be working by Shilen's power. I don't know the details, but my superiors want me to burn them.<br>
But there are just so many. Could you help?<br>
