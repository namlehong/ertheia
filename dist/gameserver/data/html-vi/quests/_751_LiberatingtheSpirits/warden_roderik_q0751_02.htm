<html><body>Guillotine Fortress Watchman Roderik:<br>
Why have you come here? This place has gotten even more dangerous after the corpses from Shilen's catastrophe were dumped here. It's dangerous, so you should leave.<br>
You're far too weak to be here.<br>
(This quest is only for players that are level 95 or above.)<br>
