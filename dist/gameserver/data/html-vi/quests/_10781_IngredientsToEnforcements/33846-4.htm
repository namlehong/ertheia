Paterson's Disciple Bacon:<br>
For now, I'm going to try and harness the energy of the Wind Spirit Realm to reinforce the barrier. It may be weakening the barrier, but I believe if you utilize it carefully, the barrier can be strengthened by it.<br>
The only problem is getting some of that energy. I think these monsters are the solution. They're most certainly being affected by the same energy. Go catch <font color="LEVEL">Corpse Looter Stakato and Lesser Laikel</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Sea of Spores</font> and bring back <font color="LEVEL">20 Wind Spirit Fragments.</font></body>
