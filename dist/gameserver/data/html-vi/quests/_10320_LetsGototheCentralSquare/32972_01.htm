Welcome to the newly reconstructed Talking Island Village. It only took a few months for us to get to where we are now.<br>
It must be odd getting started in a town that isnt your old home. Fear not, you are not alone. Adventurers of all races start their journey here in Talking Island Village. If you want I can help you get familiar with your new surroundings. <br>
