<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h Quest _237_WindsOfChange 30969-08a.htm">"You should lend your support to Dr. Helvetica."</button>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h Quest _237_WindsOfChange 30969-08b.htm">"You should lend your support to Priestess Athenia."</button>
