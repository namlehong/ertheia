Hey, stranger! You'd better be careful if you leave this village! Things have gotten very dangerous out there! Tensions have reached the boiling point between the <font color="LEVEL">Varka Silenos of the west</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">Ketra Orcs of the north</font>! Even if they kill each other off, there are worse beasts to replace them! Well, come to think of it, if they kill each other off, our guards would have things a bit easier... <br>
You should definitely stay out of their way!<br>
