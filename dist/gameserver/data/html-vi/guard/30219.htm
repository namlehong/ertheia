May the blessing of moonlight be with you... My name is Veltress, one of the sentinels. We are called the watch of the forest.<br>
If you cross the bridge you see here, you can follow the road to <font color="LEVEL">Lake Iris.</font> Legend has it that the lake was formed from the tears of the goddess Eva.<br>
