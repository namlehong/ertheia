Greetings, brave adventurer of Aden!<br>
My name is Jack Sage from Eva's Temple. According to Eva's Oracle, <font color="LEVEL">the world is now facing a great danger</font>. So great, in fact, that in our current state we cannot cope with it. As a consequence, Eva's Temple and the Magic Research Institute have decided to provide an ancient magic, which had been sealed long ago, to every adventurer who wishes to improve their abilities. It is called the <font color="LEVEL">Gift of Vitality</font>. The Gift of Vitality <font color="LEVEL">fills the vitality up to level 4 and maintains that state for 2 hours!</font> We shall do our best to overcome the imminent danger.<br>
May Eva's blessing accompany you on your journey.<br>
