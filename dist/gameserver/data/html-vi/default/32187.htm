I heard the sound of your stamping feet before, haven't I? This is the holy altar of Nornil? Keep quiet and show reverence!<br>
Do you intend to enter <font color="LEVEL">Nornill's Cave</font>? Then be warned. It is the birthplace of most of the monsters on the Isle of Souls. Many Kamael have entered through the years; few have ever emerged.<br>
You have chosen a thorny path indeed... <br>
