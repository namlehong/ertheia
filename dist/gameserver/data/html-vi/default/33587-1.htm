If you allow me to break the fourth wall for a moment, new or returning players who have not played Lineage II in awhile might find some aspects of the game have changed or are a bit challenging. <br>
The Mentor/Mentee system was designed to help anyone who is in that situation. <br>
A more experienced player will fill the role as the Mentor, while the new or inexperienced player will be the Mentee.<br>
