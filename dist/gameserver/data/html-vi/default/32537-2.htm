As if they're the flames that have been put out, the low moaning sound from falling souls spreads over the other side of the gap.<br>
It seems to be a passage to <font color="LEVEL">Hall of Erosion</font> where the souls are sucked into Ekimus and part of Seed of Immortality.<br>
(Hall of Erosion is an instant zone exclusively for command channel where minimum 18 and maximum 27 people can enter.)<br>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_hoe_enter">Enter to the Hall of Erosion.</button>
